# Instructions

1. Create a new React project with Vite. Your goal is to recreate the UI design shown in weather-app-design.png in the assets folder
2. You will need to create a Components folder in src, and a create a new component for the weather cards.
3. Use props for the image, title, and subtitle of the weather cards
4. The assets folder contains all of the images for the weather app. The assets folder should go inside of the src folder
5. The button needs to render on the screen but does not need to be functional

Here is an example of how you can import the images into a component file:
import img1 from "./assets/weather-1.png";
import img2 from "./assets/weather-2.png";
import img3 from "./assets/weather-3.png";
import img4 from "./assets/weather-4.png";
